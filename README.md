# Model-based online implementation of spike detection algorithms for neuroengineering applications

This work aimed at designing and implementing in Simulink environment different kind of spike detection algorithms to evaluate the best candidate for the next FPGA implementation of a closed-loop system. Moreover, by exploiting a model-based design approach it is possible to simulate, analyze and forecast pros and cons of the code execution on hardware and to conduct preliminary observations about how the algorithms behave in real-time
