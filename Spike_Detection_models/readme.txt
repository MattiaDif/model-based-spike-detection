Project structure:
-Model divided between SINGLE and MULTI-channel MODALITIES
-MODALITIES subdivided by spike detection FAMILY: sample thresholding (spike detected if it is above a threshold), energy operator (operator computation to enhance the high frequency content), template matching (spike detection based on the similarity between a waveform and a template)

sch --> single channel
mch --> multi-channel
float --> floating point model
